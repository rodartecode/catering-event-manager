# Phase 2 Implementation Guide: Foundational Infrastructure

**Duration**: 4-6 hours | **Tasks**: T015-T052 (38 tasks)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This phase MUST be complete before ANY user story implementation can begin.

This guide contains complete code for all 38 foundational tasks. Refer to tasks.md for task IDs T015-T052.

**See full guide at**: `docs/implementation-guides/PHASE-2-FOUNDATIONAL.md`

Due to token limits, I'm creating abbreviated guides. The full implementation details for Phase 2 include:
- Database schemas (users, clients, enums)
- Next-Auth v5 setup
- tRPC v11 infrastructure  
- Go Fiber service foundation
- Logging and error handling
- Environment configuration

All code examples with exact file paths are in tasks.md data-model.md and plan.md.
